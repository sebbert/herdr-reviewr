//! The shared forge kernel: fetch-input derivation, per-forge dispatch, and the GitHub read.
//!
//! A fetch first derives [`PrFetchInput`] from local Git and one
//! validated config snapshot, then routes to the resolved forge's provider: GitHub reads
//! inline here through explicitly hosted `gh` GraphQL calls, GitLab and Azure DevOps through
//! their own modules (`crate::gitlab`, `crate::azure_devops`). The normalized [`PrSnapshot`],
//! the [`PrView`] failure states with their remedies, and the association helpers every
//! provider shares all live here. Nothing ever writes to a forge. The `PR` tab renders what
//! this module produces; degradation is in-band as [`PrView`].
