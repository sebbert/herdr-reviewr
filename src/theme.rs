//! The color model: named palettes, derivation from anchors, and selection.
//!
//! A theme is a few anchor colors plus a paired syntax theme;
//! every other slot is derived from the anchors. One theme — `catppuccin` — instead
//! pins its whole palette as a literal, to stay byte-identical to the pre-theming
//! colors. One selection sets both the chrome `Palette` and the syntax theme, so they
//! never desync. The pane background stays the terminal's, so only these fills and the
//! syntax foregrounds are painted.

// This file is a color table; 6-digit `0xRRGGBB` literals read better grouped as one value.
